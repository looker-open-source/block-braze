# Braze

This block is based on the [Braze Schema](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/braze) provided by [Fivetran's ETL](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/braze/setup-guide) or Looker's managed ETL via [The Connection Hub](https://docs.looker.com/setup-and-management/connecting-to-db#new_database).

The Looker Block for Braze illuminates your customer’s engagement behavior, helping you identify cross-channel marketing experiences that build lasting relationships. Whether creating a personalized Canvas for your dedicated base or starting a novel campaign, this block will help you:

- Consolidate Campaign and Canvas metrics into a single source.
- Expose campaign performance by channel and platform.
- Drill into a campaign’s enrollment and conversion behavior.
- Identify common behaviors leading to conversion events.
- Highlight trends in Canvas step distributions and engagement.
- Compare performance of entry events, variations and channels.

As with other Looker Blocks, you can easily customize the data model to fit your business needs. Use the Campaign Explore to tailor the included campaign dashboards to fit your reporting metrics on campaign reach,  engagement, and performance. Use the Canvas Explore to curate the Advanced Canvas Analytics dashboard to help highlight what entry events, messaging variants and step sequences lead to effective marketing experiences. Use this Block to connect [Braze's data-driven approach](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/) to a world class data platform.
